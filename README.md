# Standard Version

> stop using `npm version`, use `standard-version` it rocks!

Automatic versioning, CHANGELOG generation, and
[conventional commit messages](https://conventionalcommits.org).

Based on [bk-conventional-changelog](https://github.com/sportheroes/bk-conventional-changelog) and [bk-conventional-recommended-bump](https://github.com/sportheroes/bk-conventional-recommended-bump).

## How it works

When you're ready to release to npm:
  1. `git checkout master; git pull origin master`
  2. run `standard-version`
  3. `git push --follow-tags origin master; npm publish`

`standard-version` does the following:

1. bumps the version in _package.json/bower.json_ (based on your commit history)
2. uses [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to update _CHANGELOG.md_ using [SportHeroesGroup's preset](https://github.com/sportheroes/bk-conventional-changelog)
3. commits _package.json (et al.)_ and _CHANGELOG.md_
4. tags a new release

## Installation

### As `npm run` script

Install and add to `devDependencies`:

```
npm i --save-dev standard-version
```

Add an [`npm run` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) to your _package.json_:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version"
  }
}
```

Now you can use `npm run release` in place of `npm version`.

This has the benefit of making your repo/package more portable, so that other developers can cut releases without having to globally install `standard-version` on their machine.

### As global bin

Install globally (add to your `PATH`):

```
npm i -g standard-version
```

Now you can use `standard-version` in place of `npm version`.

This has the benefit of allowing you to use `standard-version` on any repo/package without adding a dev dependency to each one.

## CLI Usage

### First Release

To generate your changelog for your first release, simply do:

```sh
# npm run script
npm run release -- --first-release
# or global bin
standard-version --first-release
```

This will tag a release **without bumping the version in package.json (_et al._)**.

When ready, push the git tag and `npm publish` your first release. \o/

### Cut a Release

If you typically use `npm version` to cut a new release, do this instead:

```sh
# npm run script
npm run release
# or global bin
standard-version
```

As long as your git commit messages are conventional and accurate, you no longer need to specify the semver type - and you get CHANGELOG generation for free! \o/

After you cut a release, you can push the new git tag and `npm publish` (or `npm publish --tag next`) when you're ready.

### Release as a pre-release

Use the flag `--prerelease` to generate pre-releases:

Suppose the last version of your code is `1.0.0`, and your code to be committed has patched changes. Run:

```bash
# npm run script
npm run release -- --prerelease
```
you will get version `1.0.1-0`.

If you want to name the pre-release, you specify the name via `--prerelease <name>`.

For example, suppose your pre-release should contain the `alpha` prefix:

```bash
# npm run script
npm run release -- --prerelease alpha
```

this will tag the version `1.0.1-alpha.0`

### Release as a target type imperatively like `npm version`

To forgo the automated version bump use `--release-as` with the argument `major`, `minor` or `patch`:

Suppose the last version of your code is `1.0.0`, you've only landed `fix:` commits, but
you would like your next release to be a `minor`. Simply do:

```bash
# npm run script
npm run release -- --release-as minor
# Or
npm run release -- --release-as 1.1.0
```

you will get version `1.1.0` rather than the auto generated version `1.0.1`.

> **NOTE:** you can combine `--release-as` and `--prerelease` to generate a release. This is useful when publishing experimental feature(s).

### Prevent Git Hooks

If you use git hooks, like pre-commit, to test your code before committing, you can prevent hooks from being verified during the commit step by passing the `--no-verify` option:

```sh
# npm run script
npm run release -- --no-verify
# or global bin
standard-version --no-verify
```

### Signing commits and tags

If you have your GPG key set up, add the `--sign` or `-s` flag to your `standard-version` command.

### Lifecycle scripts

`standard-version` supports lifecycle scripts. These allow you to execute your
own supplementary commands during the release. The following
hooks are available and execute in the order documented:

* `prebump`/`postbump`: executed before and after the version is bumped. If the `prebump`
  script returns a version #, it will be used rather than
  the version calculated by `standard-version`.
* `prechangelog`/`postchangelog`: executes before and after the CHANGELOG is generated.
* `precommit`/`postcommit`: called before and after the commit step.
* `pretag`/`posttag`: called before and after the tagging step.

Simply add the following to your package.json to configure lifecycle scripts:

```json
{
  "standard-version": {
    "scripts": {
      "prebump": "echo 9.9.9"
    }
  }
}
```

### Skipping lifecycle steps

You can skip any of the lifecycle steps (`bump`, `changelog`, `commit`, `tag`),
by adding the following to your package.json:

```json
{
  "standard-version": {
    "skip": {
      "changelog": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Committing generated artifacts in the release commit

If you want to commit generated artifacts in the release commit (e.g. [#96](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version/issues/96)), you can use the `--commit-all` or `-a` flag. You will need to stage the artifacts you want to commit, so your `release` command could look like this:

```json
"prerelease": "webpack -p --bail",
"release": "git add <file(s) to commit> && standard-version -a"
```

### Dry run mode

running `standard-version` with the flag `--dry-run` allows you to see what
commands would be run, without committing to git or updating files.

```sh
# npm run script
npm run release -- --dry-run
# or global bin
standard-version --dry-run
```

### CLI Help

```sh
# npm run script
npm run release -- --help
# or global bin
standard-version --help
```

## Code usage

Use the `silent` option to stop `standard-version` from printing anything
to the console.

```js
var standardVersion = require('standard-version')

// Options are the same as command line, except camelCase
standardVersion({
  noVerify: true,
  infile: 'docs/CHANGELOG.md',
  silent: true
}, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(`standard-version failed with message: ${err.message}`)
  }
  // standard-version is done
})
```

## Commit Message Convention, at a Glance

_patches:_

```sh
git commit -a -m "‚ú¥Ô∏è [FIX] (parsing) fixed a bug in our parser"
```

_features:_

```sh
git commit -a -m "‚úÖ [ADD] (parser) we now have a parser \o/"
```

_breaking changes:_

```sh
git commit -a -m "‚úÖ [ADD] (new-parser) introduces a new parsing library
BREAKING CHANGE: new library does not support foo-construct"
```

_other changes:_

You decide, e.g., docs, chore, etc.

```sh
git commit -a -m "‚òëÔ∏è [DOC] fixed up the docs a bit"
git commit -a -m "üîÑ [MOD] (controllers) Changed implementation"
git commit -a -m "üîÄ [TEST] (services) Adjusted MemoryRange unit tests"
```

_but wait, there's more!_

Github usernames (`@bcoe`) and issue references (#133) will be swapped out for the
appropriate URLs in your CHANGELOG.
